# 👋 Hi there! I'm Sumanth Ravuri

🎯 Backend Developer | Full Stack Learner | CS50 Certified | Ex-UPSC Aspirant | IIT Delhi Alum

I'm a passionate software developer with a strong foundation in **Java**, **Python**, and **Spring Boot**, actively exploring **microservices**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and cloud technologies. I’ve built scalable full-stack applications with **Django**, **React.js**, **REST APIs**, and **JWT/OAuth2** security protocols.

I bring the analytical rigor of a 3x UPSC Mains qualifier and the technical agility of a CS50-certified engineer to every project I take on. I enjoy solving complex problems, working with clean architecture, and continuously pushing myself to learn.
